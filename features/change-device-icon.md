There are several built-in icons and also there is a possibility to upload custom images.

For current running browser it will be applied right after changing setting. For mobile version and other browsers (in another tab, another browser, or another desktop) it will be applied next time latest positions are loaded (by default 15 seconds, can be changed in Settings >> Global ('Update interval')).

To upload custom icons use 'Add' button on toolbar of screen with a list of all available icons. To edit uploaded custom icon use 'Edit' button, it is possible to update just one icon type (i.e. just 'selected' or just 'offline'). To remove custom icon use 'Remove' button.
