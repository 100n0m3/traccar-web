On the 'Maintenance' tab of device profile there is a possibility to define maintenance intervals.

There is an 'Odometer' field used to calculate which maintenance is required at the moment. 'Auto' checkbox indicates that odometer must be updated automatically by scanning of received positions and summing up distance.

'Reset' button sets 'Last service' field to the current odometer value.

It is also possible to copy all maintenance settings from another device. To do that select it in 'Copy from:' drop down list and click the 'Copy from:' button.

When maintenance is required: 

* on a map such device/vehicle appears in a red circle
* new event is recorded to the underlying database, which can then be sent as a notification (if enabled in user profile)
