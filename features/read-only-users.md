title: Read-only users

Any user can be marked as read-only either by `administrator` or by `manager` user in Settings >> User screen:

![Marking user as read-only](http://i62.tinypic.com/2ldxego.png)

Read-only user cannot apply any modifications to the underlying database (even cannot change his own account information). This is what is available for such users:

* latest positions of shared devices
* archived positions of shared devices
* tracker server log (for read-only administrative account).

In UI such user will have only 'Logout' button (and Settings >> Tracker server log for administrative account).
