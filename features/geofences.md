This long-waiting issue was added in scope of [issue #100](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/100). List of geo-fences is available at the left side of screen on 'Geo-fences' tab.

Once switched to that tab 'Add/Edit/Share/Delete' buttons at top are acting for Geo-fences. When current tab is 'Devices' then they are working for devices.
