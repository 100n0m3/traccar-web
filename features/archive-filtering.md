There are five filtering options.

1. Hide zero coordinates - will not show positions with zero values in longitude and latitude.

2. Hide invalid locations - will not show positions with 'valid' flag set to 'false'.

3. Hide duplicates - will not show positions that have exactly same date and time.

4. Ignore locations with distance from previous point less than X miles/km. Does as it says. Leave blank to disable this filter.

5. Speed. Applies some filtering to the 'speed' column. To disable either leave blank condition ('<', '>', etc.) or value.

To disable all filters at once check 'Disable filter' box.
