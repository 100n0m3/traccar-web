Today I am pleased to announce that after about a month of work there is a first usable version of [geo-fences](/features/geofences.html) function. Please note that for now notifications are not implemented. It is available for testing and any feedback is welcome in [issue tracker](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/100). What is working now:

* separate tab for 'geo-fences' in left-side panel
* ability to add/edit/delete geo-fences. [More details in feature page](/features/geofences.html)
* sharing geo-fences between users
* geo-fence calculation for latest device/vehicle positions - popup contains list of geo-fences with colored boxes

Happy geofencing!
