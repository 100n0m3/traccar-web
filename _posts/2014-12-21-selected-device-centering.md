Before when one selected device in devices table at the left hand side it was centered, but just for the first time. If map or device/vehicle was moved to find it's current location it required to deselect and then select it again. Now every click on device row will put it on the center of map.

Implemented for [feature request #48](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/48).
