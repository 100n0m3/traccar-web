Today's [Friday 13th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th) release does not include any major features. It's mostly a bugfix release including the following:

* show error message box when device is not selected prior to hitting 'Export' button (for [#82](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/82))
* ability to export/import 'Other' field to/from GPX (thanks to [Antonio Fernandes](https://github.com/antoniopaisfernandes))
* fixed logging in Export/Import servlet to catch [#91](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/91)
* removed excessive positions sorting in archive to fix (or at least minimize) [#83](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/83) and [#87](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/87)

Wish you all a good weekend!
