Two major features are included in today's release: ['offline' devices email notifications](/features/notifications.html) and [archive styling](/features/archiv-styling.html).

Also there are following minor improvements done:

* disabled resizing and moving of login dialog (thanks to [Jeferex](https://github.com/Jeferex))
* system will not create user with 'admin' name if any other user with 'administrator' role already present (thanks to [pallavt](https://github.com/pallavt))
* grouped import/export buttons on archive toolbar in menu ([issue #69](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/69))
* disallow devices with empty name or id ([issue #64](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/64))

Many thanks to [Antonio Fernandes](https://github.com/antoniopaisfernandes) for implementing [archive styling](/features/archive-styling.html).
