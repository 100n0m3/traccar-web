Moved from github's README to a separate web site. It helps to organize existing and upcoming information better.

I have big plans on the web site and project:

1) Post new features announcements along with separate description page.

2) Add short-description pages for currently implemented [features](/features/) (with screenshots, etc.)

3) Create installation package with traccar backend and traccar-web.war built with new features.

4) Launch online demo version.

5) Put some kind of 'donate' page or introduce paid support (custom development, installation help, devices configuration help, traccar backend help, etc.).
