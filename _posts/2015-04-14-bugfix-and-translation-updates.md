Fixed issue [#144](https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web/issues/144) in mobile UI - latest positions of devices were loaded inconsistently (device marker disappeared from time to time). Also fixed couple of minor issues:

* 'radius' field was enabled when editing polygon geo-fence while it does not make sens for this type of geo-fences.
* device selection by clicking on latest position on map was not working
